# Rails jQuery FlInstagram

## Description

FlInstagram is blowing up! All of the users love the ability to like a photo, but they don't like how it refreshes the page everytime they do so. It's time to add some Ajax to this rails app!

## TODO
1. build basic app
[]users model(have many pictures)
  []name
  []followers
  []following
[]pictures(belong to users)
  []picture
  []likes
  []comments?(not yet)

views: timeline

objective: show a timeline with 7-10 images. the user should be able to like or unlike a photo. no comments.

does there need to be an admin model?

2. create solution branch using jquery and ajax

notes: no ability to comment yet?
