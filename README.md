# Rails jQuery FLInstagram

## Description

FLInstagram is blowing up! All of the users love the ability to like a photo, but they don't like how it refreshes the page everytime they do so. It's time to add some Ajax to this rails app!

## TODO
2. create solution branch using jquery and ajax
3. create more seed data

NOTES: 

make sure to run:
`rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test`
before running rspec
